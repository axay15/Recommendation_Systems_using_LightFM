# Recommendation_Systems_using_LightFM

Recommender Systems are of 2 types:
1) Collaborative: Predict what you like based on what other similar users have liked in the past.
2) Content-Based: Predict what you like based on what you have liked in the past.

This recommendation system suggests movies a user would like using the LightFM recommendation library.
